		<em>The problem typically solved by dependency injection in object-oriented programming is solved in a completely different way in functional programming.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Several years ago, I wrote a book called <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">Dependency Injection in .NET</a>, which was published in 2011. The book contains examples in C#, but since then I've increasingly become interested in functional programming to the extent that I now consider F# my primary language.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that combination, it's no wonder that people often ask me how to do dependency injection in functional programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've seen more than one answer, from other people, explaining how partial function application is equivalent to dependency injection. In a small series of articles, I'll explain both why this is true, but also why it's <em>not functional</em>. I'll conclude by showing a functional alternative to decoupling logic and (side) effects.

Bob: Fine, it's functional. How do I inject dependencies? Other man: You use a free monad which allows you to build a monad from any Functor. Bob: Did you just tell me to go fuck myself? Other man: I believe I did, Bob.">

	</p>
	<p>
		There's another school of functional programmers who believe that dependency injection in functional programming involves a Free monad.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can often make do with less, though.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my experience, it's usually enough to refactor a unit to take only direct input and output, and then compose an impure/pure/impure 'sandwich'. You'll see an example later.

		<ol>
			<li><a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/01/27/dependency-injection-is-passing-an-argument">Dependency injection is passing an argument</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">Partial application is dependency injection</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection">Dependency rejection</a></li>
		</ol>
		All the articles revolve around a common example, which is one of my favourite scenarios: on-line restaurant reservation. You can see an actual example client in my <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=pluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Ffunctional%2Darchitecture%2Dfsharp">Functional Architecture with F#</a> Pluralsight course. The (somewhat dated) client source code is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/booking-web-ui">available on GitHub</a>. The server-side F# and Haskell example code for this article series is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/dependency-rejection-samples">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The scenario is to implement an HTTP-based API that can accept incoming JSON documents that represent restaurant reservations.
	</p>
	<p>
		I should point out that nowhere in this article series do I reject dependency injection as a set of object-oriented patterns. In object-oriented programming, dependency injection is a well-known and comprehensively described way to achieve decoupling and testability. In the next article, you'll see a brief review of dependency injection in C#.
